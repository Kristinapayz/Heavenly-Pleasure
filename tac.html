        <h1> What Information Do We Collect?</h1>

    <p> 
        
        When you visit our Website, we collect two types of information: personal information you actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”) and information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and other Users browse our Website (“Passive/Aggregate Information”). <br>
        
        <br>

        1. Active Information – This refers to information that lets us know specifically about you i.e. profile information.Registration – When you register as buyer of our products and services, we will collect your Personal Data (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number) which is securely stored and accessible on our Website.Ordering – When 
        you place an order for products and services, we collect Personal Data (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and 
        other transactional information). We use this information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate the status of your order. 
        Credit Card Storage – Credit card information collected at registration or for product orders is used only to process payment for the transaction 
        and, generally, is not retained on our Website. Your credit card details are collected, processed and stored directly by our third-party payment 
        processors pursuant to their terms of use and privacy policies. <br> <br>
        
        We encrypt credit card information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personal Data is safe as it is transmitted to us. 
        To emphasize, none of your credit card details are stored with us. However, we may collect your bank account details to process refunds. <br><br>
        
        Surveys and Promotions – Occasionally, you may voluntarily provide Personally Data to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls.

        <br><br>

        2. Passive/Aggregate Information – This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Website. Our web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Website, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Website in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Passive/Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Active Information with the Passive/Aggregate Information that we collect on our Website. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personal Data under this Privacy Statement.
